# firstProject

Basic concentration/memory game with country flags - 24 cards all laid faced down and 2 cards are flipped over every turn. 
The goal is to turn over pairs of matching cards(flags) in the fewest amount of flips(clicks). If a matching pair is found,
those dissapper to deem a match. However, I ran into problems as to trying to create a two player game. Also, rather than matching
flags, my initial idea was to match the name of the country with it's countries flag. Another mistake going into
this project was starting off with css first rather than making sure the game functioned correctly. By taking that approach,
I wasted a lot of time in creating this game.
